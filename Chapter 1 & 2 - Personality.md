- **The Person-Situation Debate**
	- Walter Mischel (1968) *Personality and Its Assessment*
	- Review of research on the relationship of scores on personality measures to overt behavior
		- Can you correlate measures of behavior, by the same person/subject, at different times?
	- Concluded scores do not correlate with behavior
	- Little evidence of cross-situational consistency

- **Mischel's Conclusions** 
- Persist into current times
	- Recent review of scientific evidence about traits
		- Prominent psychologists including Goldberg
			- [*The Power of Personality (2007)*](https://classdat.appstate.edu/COB/MGT/VillanPD/OB%20Fall%202021/Unit%201%20-%20Inference/Personality%20Articles/The%20Power%20of%20Personality%202007.pdf)
	- Social psychologists accept Mischel's unjustified conclusion about traits
	- Effects of traits are as strong as situations

- **The Five Factor Theory**
	- Empirically derived data from thousands of participants
	- Traits range between two extremes
	- Majority of people are moderate in the strength of any specific trait
	- **Traits of the Five Factor Theory**
		- Neuroticism
		- Extraversion
		- Openness to Experience
		- Agreeableness
		- Conscientiousness
	- Traits are arranged in order of size of differences among people
		- Variance among people
			- Any given person may display a trait in different ways
		- Neuroticism has the greatest range of differences among people
		- Greater individual differences more likely to explain difference in behavior
	- Neuroticism
		- Tend to experience negative emotions
			- Feeling anxoius, worrying, nervous, insecure, uncertain, and unhappy
			- Moody, irritable, and depressed (*Hampton 2012*)
		- Heightened sensitivity to unpleasant situations
			- Likely to react with anger, sadness, fear, and guilt to events in daily life
		- Possible protective effect to neuroticism
			- Bereaved individuals with more neuroticism have lower mortality risk over time (*Taga et al., 2009*)
