- **The Person-Situation Debate**
	- Walter Mischel (1968) *Personality and Its Assessment*
	- Review of research on the relationship of scores on personality measures to overt behavior
		- Can you correlate measures of behavior, by the same person/subject, at different times?
	- Concluded scores do not correlate with behavior
	- Little evidence of cross-situational consistency

- **Mischel's Conclusions** 
- Persist into current times
	- Recent review of scientific evidence about traits
		- Prominent psychologists including Goldberg
			- [*The Power of Personality (2007)*](https://classdat.appstate.edu/COB/MGT/VillanPD/OB%20Fall%202021/Unit%201%20-%20Inference/Personality%20Articles/The%20Power%20of%20Personality%202007.pdf)
	- Social psychologists accept Mischel's unjustified conclusion about traits
	- Effects of traits are as strong as situations

- **The Five Factor Theory**
	- Empirically derived data from thousands of participants
	- Traits range between two extremes
	- Majority of people are moderate in the strength of any specific trait
	- **Traits of the Five Factor Theory**
		- Neuroticism
		- Extraversion
		- Openness to Experience
		- Agreeableness
		- Conscientiousness
	- Traits are arranged in order of size of differences among people
		- Variance among people
			- Any given person may display a trait in different ways
		- Neuroticism has the greatest range of differences among people
		- Greater individual differences more likely to explain difference in behavior
	- Neuroticism
		- Tend to experience negative emotions
			- Feeling anxoius, worrying, nervous, insecure, uncertain, and unhappy
			- Moody, irritable, and depressed (*Hampton 2012*)
		- Heightened sensitivity to unpleasant situations
			- Likely to react with anger, sadness, fear, and guilt to events in daily life
		- Possible protective effect to neuroticism
			- Bereaved individuals with more neuroticism have lower mortality risk over time (*Taga et al., 2009*)
**Challenge of Measuring Personality**
   - Walter Mischel (1968) tackled this in *Personality and Its Assessment*
   - Explored the correlation between personality measures and observable behavior
      - Considered the consistency of the behaviour displayed by an individual at different times
   - Inferred that behavior doesn't consistently correlate with personality scores

**Mischel's Observations**
   - Are still relevant today
     - Fresh scientific evidence on traits has been reviewed
       - Prominent psychologists, including Goldberg, were involved
       - Refer to *The Power of Personality (2007)* for more details
   - Mischel's reasoning on traits being as impactful as situations is widely accepted by social psychologists

**The Five Factor Theory**
   - Is based on empirically derived data gathered from multiple participants
   - Proposes traits that oscillate between two opposite ends
   - Most individuals show moderate strength in any particular trait

**The Five Traits**
   - Neuroticism
   - Extraversion
   - Openness to Experience
   - Agreeableness
   - Conscientiousness

**Trait Variance**
   - The traits are arranged based on the size of differences observed amongst people
   - Neuroticism displays the widest range of differences
   - Larger individual differences can potentially elucidate differences in behavior

**Neuroticism**
   - Characterised by experiences of negative emotions such as anxiety, worry, nervousness, insecurity, uncertainty, unhappiness, moodiness, irritability, and depression (Refer *Hampton 2012*)
   - Heightened sensitivity towards unpleasant situations is a key trait 
     - Provokes reactions like anger, sadness, fear, and guilt to everyday events
   - Suggested protective effect of neuroticism
      - Bereaved individuals with higher neuroticism exhibit lower mortality risk over time (*Taga et al., 2009*)
Soy guapo, soy MUY guapo. Yo voy a chupar un poco de polla, y voy a la cama, cabroncesto. Tu eres Los Retrasados Del Rey. Confeccionabas bizcochos, retrasado? Feliz navidad, amigo. El muchacho de los ojos tristes es un muchacho con no polla, y es muy cansado...
